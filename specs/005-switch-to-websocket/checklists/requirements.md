# Specification Quality Checklist: Switch to WebSocket Communication Protocol

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Iteration 2)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation History

### Iteration 1 (Failed)
Issues found:
- Implementation details in FRs (WebSocket, SSE, LangGraph, streamMode)
- Technical jargon in success criteria (code search patterns)
- Framework-specific terminology throughout

### Iteration 2 (Passed)
All issues resolved:
- Removed all framework/library-specific references
- Replaced technical terms with technology-agnostic descriptions
- Success criteria now focus on observable user outcomes
- Requirements describe capabilities without implementation details

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All checklist items passed validation
- No further spec updates required before planning phase
