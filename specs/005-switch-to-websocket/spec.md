# Feature Specification: Switch to WebSocket Communication Protocol

**Feature Branch**: `005-switch-to-websocket`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: User description: "We are switching to websocket as communication protocol. Focus on the switch, and REMOVE the old protocol. I don't want them running in parallell."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: How many concurrent connections should the system support? → A: Single-user deployment (1-5 concurrent connections) - minimal resource requirements
- Q: When a connection is interrupted mid-stream, what should happen to the partially received message? → A: Discard partial message - user retries from scratch with full request context
- Q: What is the maximum message size the system should support? → A: Standard chat messages only (1MB limit) - typical for text-based conversations
- Q: What level of observability is required for production operations? → A: Structured logging - connection lifecycle, message counts, and error details with correlation IDs
- Q: How should the system handle idle connections (no messages sent for extended period)? → A: No automatic timeout - connections remain open until user explicitly closes or navigates away

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-time Message Streaming (Priority: P1)

As a user having a conversation with the chatbot, I send a message and see the AI's response appear token-by-token in real-time, creating a natural conversational experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core streaming functionality. Without it, users cannot interact with the chatbot at all. This represents the baseline value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a single message to the chatbot and observing the streaming response character-by-character, confirming that tokens arrive progressively rather than all at once.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing an active conversation thread, **When** I send a message to the chatbot, **Then** I see individual tokens appearing progressively in the assistant's response area
2. **Given** the chatbot is streaming a response, **When** tokens arrive from the server, **Then** each token is displayed immediately without waiting for the complete message
3. **Given** the chatbot has finished streaming, **When** the final token arrives, **Then** I see the complete message with latency metrics and token usage statistics

### User Story 2 - Connection Error Handling (Priority: P2)

As a user experiencing network issues, I receive clear feedback when the connection fails and understand whether I can retry my request.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production reliability. Users need to understand when something goes wrong and what actions they can take. Without this, connection failures create a confusing and frustrating experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating network disconnections (e.g., disabling network during message send) and verifying that the UI shows appropriate error messages with retry options where applicable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I send a message, **When** the connection fails to establish, **Then** I see an error message indicating connection failure with an option to retry
2. **Given** a message is streaming, **When** the connection drops mid-stream, **Then** I see an error indicating incomplete response, the partial message is discarded, and I can retry the full request
3. **Given** I receive a server error during streaming, **When** the error is retryable, **Then** I see a clear retry button; **When** the error is non-retryable, **Then** I see an explanation without a retry option

---

### User Story 3 - Connection Lifecycle Management (Priority: P3)

As a developer or system operator, I need the system to properly manage connection lifecycles including cleanup on page navigation and component unmounting.

**Why this priority**: Critical for preventing resource leaks and ensuring system stability, but doesn't directly impact user-visible features. Users benefit indirectly through improved reliability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating between pages, refreshing the browser, and unmounting components while monitoring browser DevTools for unclosed connections or memory leaks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an active conversation with an open connection, **When** I navigate away from the chat page, **Then** the connection is properly closed
2. **Given** I am viewing multiple conversation threads, **When** I switch between threads, **Then** the previous thread's connection is closed before opening a new one
3. **Given** a message is in progress, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** the connection is gracefully terminated and can be re-established

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a connection is interrupted during token streaming (mid-message)? → Partial message is discarded; user must retry the complete request
- How does the system handle connection establishment failures (e.g., network proxy blocking persistent connections)?
- What happens if the user sends a new message while a previous response is still streaming? → Client closes the existing WebSocket connection (terminating the in-progress stream) and establishes a new connection for the new message (one-message-per-connection pattern per FR-014)
- How does the system behave when the server closes the connection unexpectedly (e.g., server restart)?
- What happens if the client receives malformed messages from the server?
- How does the system handle very large messages that exceed payload size limits? → System rejects messages exceeding 1MB with clear error message to user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST establish persistent bidirectional connections for all chat communication
- **FR-002**: System MUST completely remove all previous unidirectional streaming code and mechanisms
- **FR-003**: Server MUST send chat events using current message event types and structures (token/final/error) as structured messages containing event type and associated data
- **FR-004**: Client MUST handle incoming messages for token delivery, completion notifications, and error reporting
- **FR-005**: System MUST deliver response content progressively as it becomes available
- **FR-006**: Server MUST properly terminate connections with appropriate status indicators for normal and error conditions
- **FR-007**: Client MUST respond to connection lifecycle events including establishment, message receipt, errors, and closure
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all required chat information (conversation identifier, user identifier, message content) before processing
- **FR-009**: Server MUST communicate errors to clients through the active connection rather than connection rejection
- **FR-010**: Client MUST present connection errors with clear explanations and indicate when users can retry
- **FR-011**: System MUST release connection resources when users close the application or navigate away
- **FR-012**: Server MUST continue using existing streaming infrastructure for generating responses without changes to conversation logic
- **FR-013**: Client MUST cancel active requests when users initiate new conversations by closing the existing WebSocket connection before establishing a new one (one-message-per-connection pattern)
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce a maximum message size of 1MB for both incoming user messages and outgoing assistant responses
- **FR-015**: System MUST log connection lifecycle events (establishment, closure, errors) with correlation IDs for traceability
- **FR-016**: System MUST log message counts and error details in structured format for operational monitoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST keep connections open indefinitely without automatic timeout until user explicitly closes or navigates away

### Key Entities

- **Communication Channel (WebSocket connection)**: Represents the persistent bidirectional connection between user's browser and server. Key attributes include connection status, protocol endpoint, and pending messages. Implementation uses native WebSocket protocol with one-message-per-connection lifecycle.
- **Chat Event**: Represents a single message transmitted between client and server. Contains event classification (incremental content, completion, error) and relevant data.
- **Conversation Context**: Represents the metadata for an active chat exchange including conversation identifier, user identifier, tracking reference, and message display location.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users see chat responses appearing progressively with the first content visible within 2 seconds of sending a message
- **SC-002**: System successfully delivers complete responses for 100% of valid chat requests under normal network conditions
- **SC-003**: Connection errors display user-friendly messages within 1 second of detection, clearly indicating whether retry is possible
- **SC-004**: Communication channels are properly released within 500ms of application closure or navigation, preventing resource accumulation
- **SC-005**: Previous streaming mechanism is completely removed with zero legacy code patterns remaining in the system
- **SC-006**: Existing chat capabilities (conversation history, usage metrics, conversation management) continue functioning identically to pre-migration behavior
- **SC-007**: System recovers gracefully from connection interruptions with 95% of interrupted exchanges recoverable through user-initiated retry
- **SC-008**: System supports up to 5 concurrent connections without performance degradation (single-user deployment target)

## Assumptions

1. **Infrastructure Support**: Deployment environment supports persistent bidirectional connections without additional configuration
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Target browsers support modern persistent connection protocols
3. **Network Conditions**: Standard web network latency expectations apply; connections remain stable under typical internet conditions
4. **Authentication Method**: Persistent connections will use the same authentication mechanism as current request/response endpoints
5. **Concurrent Connections**: Each user maintains at most one active connection per conversation thread (system supports up to 5 total concurrent connections)
6. **Library Compatibility**: Required server-side communication libraries are production-ready and compatible with current server framework
7. **Testing Strategy**: Connection mocking capabilities are available for automated testing
8. **Idle Connection Management**: Connections remain open without automatic timeout; resource management relies on explicit user actions (close/navigate)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing conversation agent streaming implementation
- Current chat request/response data structures
- Conversation thread management service
- User identity validation requirements

### External Dependencies

- Server-side persistent connection management library
- Native browser bidirectional communication support
- Connection mocking library for testing

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **not** included in this feature:

- **Server-Initiated Messages**: Proactive notifications or multi-user synchronization where server initiates communication
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Client-side automatic reconnection logic with retry backoff strategies (manual retry only)
- **Advanced Connection Management**: Sophisticated connection pooling or load balancing strategies
- **Message Compression**: Payload compression optimization techniques
- **Authentication Changes**: Modifications to user authentication or authorization mechanisms
- **Connection-Level Rate Limiting**: New throttling mechanisms specific to persistent connections
- **Active Health Monitoring**: Periodic connection health checks or keepalive mechanisms beyond defaults
- **Binary Content Support**: Non-text message encoding schemes

## Migration Strategy

### Removal Approach

   - Remove content-type negotiation for old streaming mechanism
   - Update route to single persistent connection endpoint

2. **Client-Side Removal**:
   - Remove legacy streaming consumption logic
   - Remove old event parsing functions
   - Remove stream reader and buffering code
   - Replace connection initialization with new approach

3. **Dependency Cleanup**:
   - Remove obsolete server streaming dependencies
   - Verify no client-side cleanup needed (using native capabilities)

### Validation

- Confirm complete removal of previous streaming patterns through code review
- Verify all automated tests pass with new connection mocking
- Perform manual verification of message streaming behavior
