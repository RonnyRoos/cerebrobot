# Feature Specification: Memory Brain Surfacing

**Feature Branch**: `010-memory-brain-ui`  
**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Memory Brain Surfacing: Transparent, inspectable, and editable agent memory interface"

## Executive Summary

Cerebrobot's defining characteristic is its transparent, inspectable memory system. Unlike traditional chatbots that operate as black boxes, Cerebrobot allows operators to see, understand, and shape what the agent remembers. This feature surfaces the agent's "brain"—the long-term memory graph—making it visible, searchable, and editable in real-time during conversations.

**Core Value Proposition**: Operators gain unprecedented visibility into what their AI agent knows, believes, and remembers about them, with the power to correct, enhance, or prune memories as needed.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**P1: Invisible Memory Formation**
- Operators cannot see what facts the agent is storing during conversations
- No visibility into why the agent remembers certain things but forgets others
- Lack of trust due to opaque knowledge management

**P2: No Memory Control**
- Cannot correct false memories once stored (e.g., "User is allergic to peanuts" when they're not)
- Cannot manually add important context the agent might have missed
- Cannot remove outdated or irrelevant memories
- No way to understand why the agent gave a particular response based on recalled memories

**P3: Poor Memory Quality**
- Agent stores duplicate or near-duplicate memories
- Trivial facts clutter the memory space alongside important ones
- No mechanism to prioritize or organize memories by importance

**P4: Debugging Difficulty**
- When agent behavior seems off, no way to inspect what memories influenced the response
- Cannot trace agent reasoning back to specific stored facts
- Difficult to understand the agent's "mental model" of the operator

### User Impact

**Hobbyist Operators**:
- Feel frustrated by lack of control over their personal AI assistant
- Lose trust when agent makes incorrect assumptions
- Spend time in repeated conversations re-teaching the same facts

**Power Users**:
- Want to curate high-quality knowledge bases for specific use cases
- Need to audit and maintain memory hygiene over time
- Desire fine-grained control over agent knowledge domains

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Memory Visibility (Priority: P1)

As an operator having a conversation with my agent, I want to see what facts the agent is storing in real-time so that I can verify the agent is learning the right things and trust the knowledge it's building.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that addresses P1 (Invisible Memory Formation) and is the core differentiator of Cerebrobot. Without visibility, none of the other features matter. It delivers immediate value by building trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by conducting a conversation where the agent stores at least one memory, and verifying that the operator can view that memory's content and when it was created, without needing to edit or search.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am chatting with my agent, **When** the agent stores a new memory during our conversation (e.g., "User prefers dark mode"), **Then** I see an immediate notification showing what was just learned
2. **Given** I am viewing my conversation, **When** I want to see all memories the agent has about me, **Then** I can access a memory browser showing all stored facts in chronological order
3. **Given** I am viewing the memory list, **When** I look at a memory entry, **Then** I can see its content, when it was created, and when it was last updated
4. **Given** the agent stores multiple memories during a conversation, **When** I view the memory browser, **Then** I see all new memories appear in real-time without refreshing
5. **Given** I have an active conversation in one browser tab and the memory browser open in another, **When** the agent stores a new memory, **Then** both views update simultaneously

---

### User Story 2 - Memory Search and Discovery (Priority: P2)

As an operator reviewing my agent's knowledge, I want to search for memories by content so that I can quickly find specific facts the agent has stored and understand the context around them.

**Why this priority**: Builds on P1 by making large memory collections manageable. As operators use the system over time, they'll accumulate hundreds of memories. Without search, the visibility from P1 becomes overwhelming. This enables operators to debug specific agent behaviors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a set of diverse memories (at least 20), then searching for specific content and verifying that relevant memories are returned ranked by relevance, without needing edit or delete capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have accumulated many memories over time, **When** I search for a specific topic (e.g., "preferences"), **Then** I see all relevant memories ranked by how closely they match my search
2. **Given** I am searching for memories, **When** I enter a query in plain language, **Then** the system finds semantically similar memories even if the exact words don't match
3. **Given** I am viewing search results, **When** I look at each result, **Then** I can see a relevance score or indicator showing how well it matches my query
4. **Given** I search for a term that appears in many memories, **When** viewing results, **Then** the most relevant results appear first based on semantic similarity
5. **Given** I search for something with no matching memories, **When** I submit the search, **Then** I see a clear message that no memories match my query

---

### User Story 3 - Memory Correction and Editing (Priority: P3)

As an operator who has discovered an incorrect memory, I want to edit or delete that memory so that future conversations are based on accurate information and the agent doesn't perpetuate mistakes.

**Why this priority**: Addresses P2 (No Memory Control) but depends on P1 and P2 first—you must be able to see and find memories before you can correct them. This is essential for maintaining trust over long-term usage but isn't needed for initial value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a specific memory, editing its content, and verifying that the agent's future responses reflect the corrected information, independent of other memory management features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have found a memory with incorrect information, **When** I edit the memory content and save it, **Then** the updated information is stored and the agent uses the corrected fact in future conversations
2. **Given** I have identified a completely wrong or outdated memory, **When** I delete that memory, **Then** it is permanently removed and the agent no longer references it
3. **Given** I am about to delete a memory, **When** I trigger the delete action, **Then** I see a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion
4. **Given** I have edited a memory, **When** I view that memory's details, **Then** I can see the last updated timestamp reflecting my change
5. **Given** I delete or edit a memory, **When** the change is saved, **Then** I receive immediate feedback confirming the operation succeeded

---

### User Story 4 - Manual Memory Creation (Priority: P4)

As an operator setting up my agent or adding important context, I want to manually create memories so that I can proactively teach the agent facts it needs to know without waiting for them to come up organically in conversation.

**Why this priority**: While valuable, this is an optimization for power users. The core value is delivered by automatic memory formation (existing) plus visibility (P1-P3). Manual creation is a convenience feature that enhances control but isn't essential for trust or debugging.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by manually creating a new memory with specific content, then verifying it appears in the memory list and influences agent responses, without needing search, edit, or real-time notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to add important context to my agent's knowledge, **When** I create a new memory manually with specific content (e.g., "User's birthday is March 15"), **Then** the memory is stored and the agent can recall it in future conversations
2. **Given** I am manually creating a memory, **When** I submit the memory, **Then** I receive confirmation that it was successfully created
3. **Given** I have created a manual memory, **When** I view my memory list, **Then** the new memory appears alongside agent-generated memories with a clear timestamp
4. **Given** I manually create a memory, **When** the agent needs that information in conversation, **Then** it retrieves and uses the manually created fact just like automatically learned memories

---

### User Story 5 - Memory Quality Management (Priority: P5)

As an operator maintaining my agent's knowledge base over time, I want to identify and remove duplicate or low-quality memories so that the agent's knowledge remains clean, organized, and efficient.

**Why this priority**: Addresses P3 (Poor Memory Quality) but is primarily a maintenance concern for long-term users. Initial users won't accumulate enough memories to make this a pain point. This enhances the experience but isn't critical for core value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating intentionally similar memories (e.g., "User likes coffee" and "User prefers coffee"), then using duplicate detection features to identify and merge or remove them, without needing other memory management capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent has stored very similar memories, **When** I view my memory list, **Then** I can identify potential duplicates through visual indicators or grouping
2. **Given** I have identified duplicate memories, **When** I select multiple similar memories, **Then** I can choose to keep the best one and remove the others
3. **Given** the agent is about to store a new memory, **When** a very similar memory already exists, **Then** the system prevents duplicate storage and may update the existing memory instead
4. **Given** I am viewing my memories, **When** I look at the list, **Then** I can see indicators of memory quality or importance to help me prioritize what to keep
5. **Given** I have many memories in my knowledge base, **When** I reach a certain limit, **Then** I receive a warning to review and clean up old or less important memories

## Assumptions

- Operators have basic computer literacy and can navigate web interfaces
- The underlying memory storage system can handle semantic search with reasonable performance
- Operators have a stable internet connection for real-time updates
- Browsers support modern web standards for real-time communication
- Operators understand the concept of "memories" or "facts" in the context of AI agents
- Memory storage capacity limits will be sufficient for typical hobby usage (1000+ memories per operator)
- Operators trust the system enough to grant it permission to store facts about them

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** included in this feature:

- **Memory versioning and rollback**: Ability to view previous versions of edited memories or undo changes beyond immediate confirmation
- **Memory sharing**: Exporting or sharing memory collections with other operators or agents
- **Memory import**: Bulk importing memories from external sources or files
- **Advanced analytics**: Visualization of memory relationships, knowledge graphs, or trend analysis over time
- **Memory categories or tagging**: Organizing memories into user-defined categories beyond the automatic agent/user namespacing
- **Memory access controls**: Fine-grained permissions for different memory types (all memories are equally accessible to the operator)
- **Collaborative memory editing**: Multiple operators editing memories simultaneously
- **Memory source attribution**: Tracking which specific conversation or message led to each memory being created
- **Memory confidence scores**: Indicators of how certain the agent is about each fact
- **Automated memory consolidation**: System-initiated merging of similar memories without operator approval

These capabilities may be considered for future enhancements but are not required for the initial release.

## Dependencies

- Existing memory storage system must be functional and accessible
- Real-time communication channel between backend and frontend must exist or be established
- Agent must be capable of storing memories during conversations (already implemented)
- User authentication and session management must identify individual operators
- Memory search must support semantic/similarity matching beyond keyword search

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Operators may feel overwhelmed by seeing every trivial fact the agent stores
**Mitigation**: Implement relevance filtering and importance indicators to help operators focus on significant memories

**Risk**: Real-time updates may fail due to network issues, causing stale views
**Mitigation**: Include manual refresh options and clear indicators when real-time sync is disconnected

**Risk**: Operators may accidentally delete important memories
**Mitigation**: Require confirmation for all deletions and consider implementing an "undo" grace period

**Risk**: Search may return too many or too few results, frustrating operators
**Mitigation**: Provide tunable relevance thresholds and clear feedback about search quality

**Risk**: Performance may degrade with large memory collections
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination, lazy loading, and set reasonable capacity limits with warnings

**Risk**: Operators may not understand why certain memories were stored
**Mitigation**: Provide context in notifications about what triggered memory creation
