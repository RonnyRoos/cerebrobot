# Tasks: Memory Brain Surfacing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-memory-brain-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle III, this feature uses 3-tier testing: unit tests (deterministic), Postgres validation test (real DB), and manual smoke tests (real LLM/embeddings). Unit tests are included inline.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1-P5) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `apps/server/src/`, `apps/server/__tests__/`
- **Frontend**: `apps/client/src/`, `apps/client/__tests__/`
- **Shared**: `packages/chat-shared/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel if staffed (independent implementations)
  - OR sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent from US1 ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent from US1/US2 ‚úÖ
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent from US1-3 ‚úÖ
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent from US1-4 ‚úÖ

### Within Each User Story

- Backend endpoints before frontend API clients
- API clients before React hooks
- Hooks before UI components
- Core components before integration into ChatView
- Unit tests can run in parallel with implementation (TDD approach)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks [P] can run in parallel
**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T009 depends on T004; others can parallel
**Phase 3 (US1)**: 
- Backend group [P]: T010, T011, T012 (different concerns)
- Frontend group [P]: T017, T018, T023, T024 (different files)
- WebSocket: T013‚ÜíT014‚ÜíT015 (sequential)
- Integration: T019‚ÜíT020‚ÜíT021‚ÜíT022 (sequential)
**Phase 4-7**: Similar parallel patterns within backend/frontend groups
**Phase 8**: All tasks [P] except T090 (hygiene must run serially)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Backend - All parallel:
Task T010: "Implement GET /api/memory endpoint"
Task T011: "Unit test for GET /api/memory pagination"
Task T012: "Add Pino logging for memory list"

# Frontend - Component setup parallel:
Task T017: "Create MemoryBrowser component skeleton"
Task T018: "Create MemoryList component"
Task T023: "Add localStorage persistence for sidebar state"
Task T024: "Unit test for MemoryBrowser toggle"

# Then sequential integration:
Task T019 ‚Üí T020 ‚Üí T021 ‚Üí T022 (API client ‚Üí hook ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí ChatView)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (config + schemas)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (service skeleton + route registration)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (real-time visibility)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 acceptance scenarios independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - operators can now see memories in real-time!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! üéØ)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (search added)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (editing added)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (manual creation added)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (quality management added)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1 - real-time visibility)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2 - search)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P3 - editing)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 91  
**Task Count by User Story**:
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundational: 6 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 38 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Agent stores memory ‚Üí operator sees content/timestamps ‚úÖ
- US2: Search 20+ memories ‚Üí relevant results ranked ‚úÖ
- US3: Edit memory ‚Üí agent uses corrected info ‚úÖ
- US4: Manually create ‚Üí appears in list + influences agent ‚úÖ

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)
- Delivers core transparency value proposition
- 27 tasks total
- Real-time memory visibility with sidebar toggle
- Foundation for all subsequent stories

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow checklist format (checkbox, ID, [P]/[Story] labels, file paths)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/concerns, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story independently completable and testable per spec requirements
- Constitution Principle III: Unit tests inline, Postgres validation test in Phase 8 (T087), manual smoke tests in quickstart.md (T089)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Research unknowns from research.md addressed through implementation decisions (WebSocket events, pagination, duplicate detection, etc.)
