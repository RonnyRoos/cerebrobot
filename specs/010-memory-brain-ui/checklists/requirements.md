# Specification Quality Checklist: Memory Brain Surfacing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality checks completed successfully

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P5) with independent test criteria
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage addressing real-world scenarios
3. Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
4. Well-defined scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section
5. Risk analysis with mitigation strategies

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes - specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- All 5 user stories are independently testable and deliver incremental value
- Success criteria include both quantitative metrics (time, percentages) and qualitative measures (trust, satisfaction)
- No clarification markers needed - all critical decisions documented in Assumptions section
- Functional requirements are clearly testable without prescribing implementation approaches
