# Specification Quality Checklist: Server-Side Autonomy for Proactive Agent Follow-ups

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASSED
- Specification focuses on WHAT (capabilities) and WHY (user value), not HOW (implementation)
- Technical components (PostgreSQL, LangGraph, Fastify, WebSocket) are mentioned only in Dependencies section where appropriate
- User stories written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope) are complete

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All ambiguities resolved through reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section:
  - Timer persistence: Stateless restart (timers cleared)
  - Blocked message handling: Drop and log (no retry)
  - Failure recovery: Conservative approach with logging
- 38 functional requirements, all testable with clear MUST statements
- Success criteria use specific metrics (e.g., "under 1 second", "100% accuracy", "100 concurrent sessions")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "users see results" not "API response time")
- All 5 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- 6 edge cases identified covering timing, concurrency, and failure scenarios
- Out of Scope section clearly defines 12 excluded items
- Dependencies & Constraints section identifies 4 dependencies and 6 constraints
- Assumptions section documents 11 design decisions

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASSED
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (e.g., FR-009 to FR-011 support User Story 2)
- User stories cover core flows: autonomous send (P1), cancellation (P1), limits (P1), recovery (P2), isolation (P2)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-008 align with user story priorities
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language in user-facing sections
- Dependencies section appropriately lists technical requirements separate from feature description

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent. This specification demonstrates best practices:

1. **Clear Priority Hierarchy**: 3 P1 stories for MVP core, 2 P2 stories for robustness
2. **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be validated independently
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 38 functional requirements organized into 8 logical groups
4. **Measurable Success**: 8 success criteria with specific, quantifiable metrics
5. **Well-Bounded Scope**: 12 out-of-scope items prevent feature creep
6. **Risk Mitigation**: Edge cases and assumptions proactively address potential issues

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with technical planning and implementation design.
